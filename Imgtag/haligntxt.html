<pre> <big><b> &lt;HTML&gt;
          &lt;HEAD&gt;
               &lt;TITLE&gt;
                   Using the &1t;IMG&gt; tag.
               &lt;/TITLE&gt;
          &lt;/HEAD&gt;

          &lt;BODY&gt;
               &lt;CENTER&gt; &lt;H1&gt; Aligning Text And Images  &lt;/H1&gt;  &lt;/CENTER&gt;
               This example is all about letting text flow around images.

               &lt;IMG SRC="flower.jpg" WIDTH=85 HEIGHT=129 ALIGN=RIGHT&gt;

               Here's a case where the image is on the right and the text is on the left.
               Notice how the text seems to flow around the image.The image is aligned to
               the right with this HTML:&lt;IMG SRC="flower1.jpg" WIDTH=85 HEIGHT=129 
               ALIGN=RIGHT&gt;.The result looks quite impressive and professional,giving
               your page a stylish boost.On the other hand,notice what happens if you align
               the image to the left insted of to the right,as you see here in the image
               immediately below.In this case,the test is flowing around to the right of the
               image.Here,the HTML used to align the image is:
 
              &lt;IMG SRC="flower.jpg"  WIDTH=85 HEIGHT=129 ALIGN=LEFT&gt;
 
               &lt;IMG SRC="flower.jpg" WIDTH=85 HEIGHT=129 ALIGN=LEFT&gt;with this alignment,
               test continues on the right side of the image,wrapping around the image as
               needed.Using alignments like this makes it easy to present images and test together,
               mush as you'd see in a newspaper.It's a nice effect that gives your pages some impact.
               Note that if the spacing is too tight for you can increase the &1t;IMG&gt;element's
               HSPACE and VSPACE settings.
          &lt;/BODY&gt;
