          <HEAD>
               <TITLE>
                   Using the &1t;IMG&gt; tag.
               </TITLE>
          </HEAD>

          <BODY>
               <CENTER>
                   <H1>
                        Text Wrapping aroung Images
                   </H1>
               </CENTER>

               This example is all about letting text flow around images.

               <IMG SRC="flower.jpg"
                   WIDTH=85 HEIGHT=129 ALIGN=RIGHT>


               Here's a case where the image is on the right and the text is on the left.
               Notice how the text seems to flow around the image.Now I use &lt;BR CLEAR=RIGHT&gt;,

               <BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
               
               <IMG SRC="flower.jpg"
                   WIDTH=85 HEIGHT=129 ALIGN=LEFT>
                 
               Which skips to a point where the right margin is free again.Now the right margin is clear.
               but there's an image to the left.I can skip to a point where the left margin is clear 
               again with &lt;BR CLEAR=RIGHT&gt;,
           
               <BR CLEAR=LEFT>

               Which means that this text will continue after the image when the left margin is clear again.
